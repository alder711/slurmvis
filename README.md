# SlurmVis

## Brief Description

This project attempts to explore the behavior of SLURM visually. Currently, the project is in the prototyping phase and consists of several parts:

1. D3.js -> A visualization library written in Javascript used to actually visualize data.
2. Webserver -> A lightweight Python webserver to serve a D3.js application.
3. Data parser -> Parses data from `qstats.sh` into JSON for use with D3.js.
4. Data Transfer Channel -> (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) A remote channel used to gather the current state of a SLURM cluster via `qstat.sh` (e.g., SSH).
5. `qstat.sh` -> A shell script utility written by Steven Senator for parsing the output of SLURM commands into comma (and sometimes space) separated values. This is located at the SLURM cluster and is not implemented here. This is not implemented in this project.
6. SLURM cluster -> The cluster to visualize. Not implemented in this project.

## Requirements

 - Python 3.x

## Quickstart

Make sure the prerequisites are met and the environment is set up (including the Python virtual environment):

```bash
$ make prereq
```

Now start a Flask webserver on port 5000:

```bash
$ make run
```

Currently, the interface allows you to visualize several sample files pre-generated by `qstat.sh`.
